# School Management Database

## üìö Project Overview

This project showcases a **School Management Database** built using **MSSQL**. It is a fully normalized, relational database designed to manage key aspects of a school's operations, including students, teachers, classes, subjects, schedules, grades, attendance, and more. This repository serves as a comprehensive demonstration of database design, implementation, and management skills.
